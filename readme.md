# Elly language
Elly is a dynamically typed language with a c-like syntax that compiles to C (meaning that you can compile it to a native executable).
Elly aims to be fast (to run and code with), simple, readable and easy to learn.

# Overview
```
/ this example program prints the result of 1+2 by adding it with a function.
  the variable a and b holds 1 and 2 /

fn add(a, b) {
	return a+b
}
a = 1
b = 2

#this will prints 1+2
print('1+2=' + add(a,b))
```
